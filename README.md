# Sept 13 2023
- created the github repo
- Added a readme file for documentation purposes
- Transfered all of the code over from my local machiene to the github repo
- Added the config file to the gitignore list
- Pushed these changes at 1100

# Sept 25
- Added the LGLS data to the data file
- Created a for loop in the data file that prints out the playerId for the registered players in the lgls 1 bracket
- That for loop needs to be transfered into the main.py(I was having issues importing the data file)

# Oct 31
- added the new lgls data for the newer brackets
- created the lgls player data but did not add the data in

# Next objectives:
- Figure out how to automate the api calls using django
- Figure out how to automate putting the new data into the confige file and label them correctly
