# Advanced Python Final Project

This is my final project for my Advanced Python class. My intended purpose
for this project is to create my own startgg style page. This page will 
evenutally be hosted on the FHSU servers so that other people can access it.


# Packages

pip install pysmashgg

This is a package that is required for this program to work. Here is a link to the github and documentation
Pysmashgg

# Sept 13 2023
- created the github repo
- Added a readme file for documentation purposes
- Transfered all of the code over from my local machiene to the github repo
- Added the config file to the gitignore list
- Pushed these changes at 1100

# Sept 25
- Added the LGLS data to the data file
- Created a for loop in the data file that prints out the playerId for the registered players in the lgls 1 bracket
- That for loop needs to be transfered into the main.py(I was having issues importing the data file)

# Oct 31
- added the new lgls data for the newer brackets
- created the lgls player data but did not add the data in

# Dec 6
- Went in to meet with my professor to clean up my program
- He helped me add a set of new functions to help it flow

No longer needed the LGLSData file. All of that data will now be 
stored in a JSON file.
